# Unity-HokuyoEnhanced\n\n...WORK IN PROGRESS...\n\nThis project is an enhancement of the original project found at https://github.com/inoook/UnityURG\n\n*Code is still in early development stages, and improvements can definitely be made, especially in object detection.*\n\nImprovements and contributions are very much welcome.\n\nThe library is compatible with multiple Hokuyo sensors, each requiring a unique IP.\n\nPurposely designed to convert a large wall into a "touch screen", the code is written with this goal in mind. Notably, the _strength_ data from the sensor is completely ignored as it does not aid the object detection on a surface (despite the sensor being capable of detecting objects from a good distance).\n\nThe system includes a _distance cropping mechanism_ to disregard items outside of the detection area.\n\n The detection area can be constrained in two ways:\n- Rect \n ![rect](https://github.com/alkynee/Unity-HokuyoEnhanced/blob/master/rect.PNG) \n- Radius \n ![rad](https://github.com/alkynee/Unity-HokuyoEnhanced/blob/master/rad.png) \n\nIn `Rect` Mode, the sensor detects objects within a specified rectangular area. The parameters `detectRectWidth` and `detectRectHeight` define the size of the rectangle in mm. In `Radius` Mode, detection takes place within a circular sector with uniform detection distance in all directions, controlled by `maxDetectionDist`.\n\n\nBoth modes disregard items beyond the sensor, meaning 90 radians of the detectable area are compromised. \n\n# Preparation \n \nYou will require some network setting adjustments in Windows to get data: https://sourceforge.net/p/urgnetwork/wiki/ip_address_en/ \n\n# Key Files: \n\n- `URGSensorObjectDetector`\n\nThis is for "detecting" object from sensor's raw data\n\n- `UrgDeviceEthernet` \n\nThis is where we get the raw data from the sensor\n\n- `SCIP_library` \n\nUtilized by UrgDeviceEthernet for low-level communication with the sensor \n\n# Usage \n\nAttach _URGSensorObjectDetector_ to an empty GameObject or use the Prefab _Sensor Data_ \n\n# Warning \n\n*This code has mainly been tested with **Hokuyo UST-10LX**, but it should ideally work with most Hokuyo sensors.*
